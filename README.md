### About The Project

**RGB color** values are supported in **all browsers**.

An RGB color value is specified with: **rgb(red, green, blue)**.

Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the **intensity of the color** as an integer between **0 and 255**.

For example, rgb(0, 0, 255) is rendered as blue, because the blue parameter is set to its **highest value (255)** and the others are set to 0.

This **app** simulates RGB color throught **range inputs**.
